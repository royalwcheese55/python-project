| Database       | CAP Type         | Reason                           |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **MySQL**      | **CP**           | Strong ACID, consistency first   |
| **PostgreSQL** | **CP**           | Strong consistency, leader-based |
| **Oracle**     | **CP**           | Enterprise ACID guarantees       |
| **MongoDB**    | **CP (default)** | Primary-based replication        |
| **Cassandra**  | **AP**           | Always-on, eventual consistency  |
| **Redis**      | **AP**           | Availability-first replication   |

Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is a lightning-fast, open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker for applications needing low-latency data access


### 1. Pull PostgreSQL image

```bash
docker pull postgres:latest
```

### 2. Run PostgreSQL container with volume

```bash
docker run --name my-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql \
  -d postgres
```

That's it! PostgreSQL is now running with persistent storage.

## What Each Flag Means

- `--name my-postgres` - Names your container
- `-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword` - Sets the password for user `postgres`
- `-p 5432:5432` - Maps port 5432 (host:container)
- `-v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql` - Creates a named volume for data persistence
- `-d` - Runs in detached mode (background)
- `postgres` - The image name

## Connection Details

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: postgres
Username: postgres
Password: mypassword
```

### Recreate container using same volume (data restored)

```bash
docker run --name my-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -d postgres
```

## Quick Test

After starting the container, test the connection:

```bash
docker exec -it my-postgres psql -U postgres -c "SELECT version();"
```

You should see PostgreSQL version information printed out.

BASE
BASE stands for basically available, soft state, and eventually consistent. The acronym highlights that BASE is opposite of ACID, like their chemical equivalents.

Basically available
Basically available is the database’s concurrent accessibility by users at all times. One user doesn’t need to wait for others to finish the transaction before updating the record. For example, during a sudden surge in traffic on an ecommerce platform, the system may prioritize serving product listings and accepting orders. Even if there is a slight delay in updating inventory quantities, users continue to check out items.

Soft state
Soft state refers to the notion that data can have transient or temporary states that may change over time, even without external triggers or inputs. It describes the record’s transitional state when several applications update it simultaneously. The record’s value is eventually finalized only after all transactions complete. For example, if users edit a social media post, the change may not be visible to other users immediately. However, later on, the post updates by itself (reflecting the older change) even though no user triggered it.

Eventually consistent
Eventually consistent means the record will achieve consistency when all the concurrent updates have been completed. At this point, applications querying the record will see the same value. For example, consider a distributed document editing system where multiple users can simultaneously edit a document. If User A and User B both edit the same section of the document simultaneously, their local copies may temporarily differ until the changes are propagated and synchronized. However, over time, the system ensures eventual consistency by propagating and merging the changes made by different users.

# CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete, the four fundamental operations for managing and manipulating data in persistent storage like databases, forming the backbone of most data-driven applications
